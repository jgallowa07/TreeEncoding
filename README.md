# TreeEncoding
This is the starting code for endcoding an msprime TreeSequence Object into a 3D array for ML and visualization purposes



## Installation

To install `tsencode`, do
```
git clone https://github.com/jgallowa07/tsencode
cd tsencode
python setup.py install --user
```
You should also be able to install it with `pip install pyslim`.
You'll also need an up-to-date [tskit](https://github.com/tskit-dev/tskit)

To run the tests to make sure everything is working, do:
```
python -m nose tests
```

*Note:* if you use `python3` you may need to replace `python` with `python3` above.
